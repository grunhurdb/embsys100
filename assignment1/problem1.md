A ring doorbell would be an example of an embedded device.  It should habe 3 digital input/outputs a button input, a video input and a wifi modem input/output device.  The device has a permenent connection to the wifi modem.  It monitors the button and when it is pressed it takes a picture using the camera and sends it over the modem.

Some challengs with developing it would be

Debugability 
no screen or keyboard, all has to be done over the modem.

Testability
Only input/output the developer would have would be through the wifi connection

Power consumption
Device would be wired directly into a houses electrical system

Cost
Amazon sells alot of them there would be pressure to minimize the unit costs.
